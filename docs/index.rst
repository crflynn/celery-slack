Celery-slack is a `Celery <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/index.html>`_
extension that posts messages to a Slack channel
regarding a Celery application, its beat schedule, and its worker task
execution. Optionally, those messages can link to
`Flower <http://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ task pages.
